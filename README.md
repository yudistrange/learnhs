# learnhs
A repository to learn and experiment with haskell

## Initial Dev Setup

### Building and Dependency Management
We will use the stack tool for building and managing dependency for the haskell project
- Installation steps can be found at: `https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/`

### IDE
We can probably use VS Code for this purpose. We would also be using the hie plugin for auto-completion and other IDE features
- Please follow the instructions at: `https://www.vacationlabs.com/haskell/environment-setup.html#hie-installation`
